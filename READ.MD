# INSTALLATION

**NOTE** This is for the TripTailor team to have a local instance working on their devices. Most of the configuration will be editing autogenerated settings.py file.

First go to `INSTALLED_APPS` - add `"triptailor"` so that it looks like this:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'triptailor'
]
```

Second if we get the database set up you'll need to change `DATABASES`:

```text
code here
```

Third we need to change all our `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to equal `[*]` or your internal IP or domain pointing to your IP

Fourth we need to edit urls.py under our `basesite` folder:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('triptailor.urls')), #add this
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
]

```

That should be all to configure. However, all is lost if your filestructure doesn't look like:

```
project
 | - basesite
 |   | settings.py
 |   | urls.py
 |   | views.py
 |   | wsgi.py
 |
 | - triptailor
 |   | migrations
 |   | static
 |   | templates
 |   | - all them python files
 |
 | - triptailorenv
 |   | all that stuff too
 |
 | - .gitignore
 | - manage.py
 | - READ.MD
```
